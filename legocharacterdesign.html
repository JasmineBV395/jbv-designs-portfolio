                <p class="project-background-body">Before graduating from Leeward Community College in Spring 2025, I took 3D Modeling
                    and Animation as one of my final requirements. One of the assignments for the course was to create and model an
                    original LEGO character as a way to learn the fundamentals of designing a 3D animated model.

                </h2>
                <p class="project-detail-body">For this assignment, my class used Autodesk Maya. I was already familiar with placing and
                    extruding objects, as well as creating simple animations such as squash-and-stretch, so building a
                    LEGO character didn’t seem too challenging. However, I was not very familiar with the LEGO brand
                    itself, as I hadn’t researched it much beforehand. Because of that, creating a unique design with a
                    required character background proved to be twice as difficult.

                <h3 class="project-detail-h3 px-4 pb-3">Research</h3>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-2">Our instructor asked us to create an original LEGO character based on either an
                    existing piece of media, one of LEGO’s own series, or a world of our own creation. Initially,
                    after looking up existing LEGO brands, I planned to design a character based on The Invisible Man
                    for the pre-existing LEGO series, Monster Fighters. However, due to time constraints, I decided it
                    would be easier to create my own character and world.
                </p>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">My LEGO character is named Ambrosia Carter, an open-minded yet overthinking 26-year-old archaeologist
                    living in a distant future blended with gothic fiction and Lovecraftian horror. Her goal is to reconstruct
                    Earth’s lost history without succumbing to insanity from horrors beyond her comprehension, including
                    hideous monsters that roam the world and ancient ruins that unsettlingly resemble hospitals or laboratories.
                    Ambrosia carries a satchel and shovel, both for self-defense and her work.
                </p>

                <h3 class="project-detail-h3 px-4 pb-3">Sketching</h3>
                <p class="project-detail-body">My instructor provided a LEGO character design template to help us fit our concepts
                    into the proportions of a LEGO minifigure. Using the template, I focused on balancing simplicity with
                    characterization through facial expressions and clothing suited to the nature and timeline of Ambrosia’s world.
                </p>

                    alt="LEGO Character Design Model (Template created by Instructor [Curtis Furumoto])">
                
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">Based on her background, Ambrosia mostly wears old-fashioned clothing: a rolled-up, puffy-sleeve blouse,
                    tucked-in pants, gloves, boots, and a belt. She also wears glasses, a ribbon-brooch tie, and has dark circles
                    under her eyes to emphasize her personality. I also sketched her shovel and satchel to resemble existing LEGO
                    accessories, such as Indiana Jones’s satchel.
                </p>
        
                <h3 class="project-detail-h3 px-4 pb-3">Modeling</h3>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-2">Following the instructor’s materials, we constructed our LEGO figures by manipulating basic objects
                    (cylinders, cubes, etc.), creating textures after UV mapping the surfaces, and applying a skeleton with
                    painted joint weights to produce a functional 3D model for animation.
                </p>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">I began by modeling the base LEGO figure using simple object shapes, extruding surfaces, adding edge loops to
                    match LEGO proportions, and adjusting vertices as needed. Because my character has custom hair and accessories,
                    I had to model them from scratch based on my sketches and standard 3D modeling techniques. This part was
                    challenging but enjoyable.
                </p>

                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">Moving forward, we had to get started on UV Mapping for each limb and accessory to prepare surfaces for
                    texturing. We separated the UVs into flattened 2D shapes after applying a template UV map to prevent
                    stretching. This made painting textures easier and helped identify which surfaces belonged to which parts
                    (e.g., face, neck). Since it was my first time UV mapping, I struggled particularly with the hair and
                    accessories, and my initial results weren’t perfect. However, the process taught me why UV mapping is essential
                    and how it can ultimately save time in future 3D projects. Afterward, I applied my custom textures I designed
                    in Procreate and made a few final adjustments.

                <h3 class="project-detail-h3 px-4 pb-3">Finalizing</h3>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-2">Finally, we moved onto the Rigging stage, where we applied a skeleton, bound joints to the model, and painted
                    skin weights so the mesh would deform correctly. Adding the skeleton and labeling the joints was
                    straightforward, but weight painting required far more trial and error than I expected.
                </p>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-2">Weight painting determines how strongly each vertex follows each joint: white indicates full influence,
                    while green, blue, and black represent decreasing influence. At first, I struggled to understand this, and I
                    often had to restart or reapply the skeleton. At times, paint would glitch or apply incorrectly until I found
                    alternative approaches. The satchel was especially difficult; I initially added multiple joints to make it
                    behave like a real bag. However, my instructor later explained that one joint would have been enough and far
                    more efficient.
                </p>
                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">In the end, I was able to move the model smoothly and experiment with body
                    language and accessory movement.
                </p>

                <p class="project-detail-body pb-4">
                    Despite the challenges and constant adjustments throughout the assignment, the experience was very rewarding.
                    I received a good grade, but more importantly, the project taught me how to approach future 3D assignments more
                    efficiently and creatively. Since 3D modeling and animation are subjects I hope to continue exploring for fun,
                    this project will stay with me for a long time.
